These color profiles have been carefully prepared from reputable data,
and are believed to provide reasonable performance when used by amateurs
creating cover book artwork for print-on-demand.

By the very nature of this workflow, the user is not expected to have high-end
calibrated equipment or software, and the printer is not expected to produce
standard production runs. No attempt has been made to achieve critical accuracy.
